I have used Web scraping to scrape the bye election information and Party wise results using python with the help of libraries such as

1. Beautiful Soup: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easy to navigate and search the parsed tree.
2. Requests: Although primarily used for making HTTP requests, it is often paired with Beautiful Soup for fetching web pages before parsing them.
3. Pandas: Pandas is not specifically a web scraping library but is incredibly useful for handling and manipulating data, including data extracted through web scraping. 

After I scraped the information from the website in the form of table I converted it into excel file.

After that i took Party wise result file and created a dashboard in Microsoft Power BI.
